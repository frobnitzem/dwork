# Active

    x. document ZeroMQ api

    x. create the following codes:

      x dhub
      x dquery
      x worker -- tests/kworker.cc

    x. create tests using api to run a simple workflow

    3. fix annoying shutdown issue - when to send Exit to workers.

       - should it be sent when all active jobs are assigned?

    4. libdwork - cleanup worker and document

    5. strengthen tests and error handling

       - add test for GetOrSet behavior of TaskHeap::new_task.

    6. performance benchmark

       - test protobuf with "option cc_enable_arenas = true;"

# Waiting TODO-s

    -. fix documentation error on first-build
      x fixed by disabling in default build

    x. Get cmake to generate the Task protobuf sources.


    *. Add a hub test.

    *. Integrate testing into the build / pull request process.

    *. List out minimal desired API for users of this libary.

    *. create simple test workflow examples

    *. codify actor behavior

      - implement QueryMsg / hub interaction

    *. implement system health manager

    *. implement stage-in copy jobs

    *. improve task I/O backend

    *. implement graceful shutdown - write all tasks to
       a file with the same format as 


# Re-consider expanded scope:

  * Central fields (already done):

    - ready ~> list of "ready" <TaskID>s (removed when assigned)

    - assigned/<Worker> ~> set of <TaskID>s assigned to worker

  * Additional field to handle task-associated info (not implemented):

    - waiting ~> set of "waiting" <TaskID>s (removed when ready)

    - tasks/<TaskID> ~> protobuf <Task> message associated to <TaskID>

  * Additional fields needed to handle work stealing:

    - location/<TaskID> ~> (<Worker>, <Worker>) first and last-known owners of task
